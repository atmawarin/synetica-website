## Process Teaser Section

**Headline:** How We Turn Ideas Into Traction in 8 Weeks

**Framework Overview:**

- **Blueprint (2 weeks):** Know exactly what to build before you build it. No wasted features. No wrong assumptions. We turn your vision into a decision-ready plan with clear priorities, features, and validation steps.

- **Build & Benchmark (6 weeks):** Get a real product, tested with 30 real users. Not a prototype. Not a demo. A product people actually use. Powered by AI-assisted development and modern frameworks, every feature works, loads fast, and fits user expectations. You launch with proof, not assumptions.

- **Go To Market (3 months):** Launch with evidence, not hope. Every decision backed by data from day one. We connect your product to real users through positioning, messaging, launch campaigns, and performance tracking. Get noticed. Grow early traction.

- **Grow (ongoing):** Turn early traction into sustainable growth. AI-powered optimization meets human strategy. We analyze user behavior, optimize key features, refine funnels, and scale acquisition through data-backed experimentation.

## Why We Built 2B2G Section

**Headline:** Built on Real Experience

**Content:** We've built products for Indonesia's leading companies. Those projects took months. Sometimes years. We learned: Most time was wasted on wrong assumptions, unclear priorities, and building before validating. The most important thing is shipping and then pivot. So we built our 2B2G methodology. Same quality. Different focus. We pick the most important things to validate. We set up platforms to capture feedback — how users interact, what they tell us. 8 weeks instead of 8 months. We took what worked from working with hundreds of projects and turned it into a repeatable framework that you can use.

## Featured Case Study Section

**Client:** Traveloka

**Context:** We've worked with Traveloka on multiple projects over the years. These engagements taught us what works — and what doesn't. That learning became our 2B2G framework.

**Challenge:** Traveloka needed to validate a new investor decision platform. They required clarity on what to build, fast execution, and real user validation before committing to full-scale development.

**Solution:** We delivered a working product that validated the concept before full-scale development. The project informed our approach: validate first, build second, test with real users.

**Results:** Achieved 85% user satisfaction and validated product-market fit before full-scale launch. The early validation saved months of development time and ensured the final product addressed real user needs, not assumptions.
