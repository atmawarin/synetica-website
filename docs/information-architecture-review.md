## Stakeholder Decisions & Updates

**Action Taken:** ✅ Document updated to reflect comprehensive navigation structure

### ✅ **Decision 2: Partnership Section - Keep with "Coming Soon"**

**Stakeholder Decision:** Keep Partnership in navigation but make it non-clickable or show "Coming Soon" label until Phase II/III implementation.

**Action Taken:** ✅ Document updated with note: *(Phase II/III - Coming Soon or non-clickable in initial launch)*

**Implementation Note:** Partnership navigation item should be visible but either:
- Non-clickable (disabled state)

- Links to placeholder page explaining Phase II/III timeline

---

### ✅ **Decision 3: Language Toggle - Keep for Future Implementation**

**Stakeholder Decision:** Keep language toggle in utility bar. Will be implemented via user stories with prioritization (post-MVP). It's a full feature, not MVP, but planning is included.

**Action Taken:** ✅ Document updated to note: "Language toggle will be implemented via user stories with prioritization (post-MVP)"

### ✅ **Decision 4: Solutions vs Products - Clarified**

**Stakeholder Decision:** 
- **Solutions** = Services (not engagement models)

## Medium Priority Issues

## Implementation Notes

### Development Approach

**Key Principle:** All navigation items are included in development scope. Items are **prioritized** rather than excluded. This is not an MVP-scoped project - it's a full development with prioritization.

### Implementation Priorities

1. **Phase 1 (Initial Launch):**
   - Home, Solutions, Products, Industries, Company, Process, Case Studies, Contact, Blog, Resources
   - All fully functional

2. **Phase 2/3 (Future):**
   - Partnership (currently non-clickable or "Coming Soon")
   - Language toggle (implemented via prioritized user stories)

### Documentation Improvements Needed:

1. Add **sub-navigation structure** for each top-level item
2. Define **content requirements** for each section
3. Add **user journey mapping** showing how users flow through IA
4. Include **mobile navigation** considerations (hamburger menu structure)
5. Document **Partnership placeholder** implementation approach
