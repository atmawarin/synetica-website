**Utility bar:** persistent "Book Consultation", "WhatsApp", and language toggle (EN/ID). Language toggle will be implemented via user stories with prioritization (post-MVP). Consider variant CTA: "Book 8-Week Launch Consult".

**Development Approach:** All navigation items are included in development scope. Items are prioritized rather than excluded. Partnership section will be non-clickable or show "Coming Soon" until Phase II/III implementation.
