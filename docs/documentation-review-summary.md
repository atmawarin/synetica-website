**Status:** ✅ Complete

## Overview

Comprehensive review and update of all project documentation in the `doc/` folder. All updated documents have been moved to the `docs/` folder with corrections, standardizations, and cross-references added.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Failure Rate Standardization ✅
- **Changed:** Brief updated from 70% to **80%** (product-market fit failure rate)
- **Context Added:** Clarified as "80% of digital products fail to achieve product-market fit"
- **Rationale:** Aligns with PRD and is a commonly cited, defensible statistic

### 2. Launch Date Update ✅
- **Changed:** Updated from "December 10, 2025" to **"December 1, 2025"**
- **Location:** Brief.md Constraints section

### 3. Framework Naming Standardization ✅
- **Standardized to:** **"2B2G Framework"** everywhere
- **Full form on first use:** "2B2G Framework (Blueprint → Build & Benchmark → Go To Market → Grow)"
- **Applied to:** Brief, PRD, Information Architecture

### 4. Target User Terminology ✅
- **Updated Brief to use:**
  - **"Dreamers"** (instead of "SMBs, solopreneurs")
  - **"Growing Businesses"** (instead of "corporate innovators")
- **Rationale:** Consistent persona naming across all documents

### 5. Navigation Structure Recommendations ✅
- **Added to Information Architecture:**
  - **Option A (Recommended):** "Services & Solutions" with outcome-focused dropdown
  - **Option B:** Simplified redirect structure
  - **Option C:** Process-first structure (like Ice House)
- **Incorporated:** Recommendations from navigation-comparison.md analysis
- **Decision Required:** Choose navigation structure (see Information Architecture Section 2.1)

### 6. Cross-References Added ✅

  - Related documents section at top
  - Links to Brief, PRD, IA, Brand Guide, Language Guidelines
- **Documents updated:**

## Outstanding Decisions Required

### 1. Services Navigation Structure
**Question:** How should Services be presented in navigation?

**Options:**
- **Option A (Recommended):** "Services & Solutions" with outcome-focused dropdown
  - Product Launch (Full 2B2G Cycle)
  - Blueprint Only
  - Growth Retainer
  - Custom Solutions
- **Option B:** Keep Services as redirect to How We Work
- **Option C:** Services organized by 2B2G phases (Blueprint, Build & Benchmark, etc.)

**Recommendation:** Option A balances process (your differentiator) with outcomes (what buyers care about). See Information Architecture Section 2.1 for details.

## Coherence Check Results

### ✅ Terminology Consistency
- Framework naming: Standardized
- User personas: Standardized
- Failure rate: Consistent (80%)

### ✅ Cross-Document Alignment
- Brief and PRD: Aligned on all key points
- Information Architecture: Reflects PRD requirements
- Brand voice: Language guidelines referenced

### ✅ Timeline Consistency
- Launch date: Updated to December 1, 2025
- All documents: Consistent timeline references

### ⚠️ Pending Decision
- Navigation structure: Requires decision on Services presentation

## Next Steps

1. **Review updated documents** in `docs/` folder
