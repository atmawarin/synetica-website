# BAND Scoring Rubric for Lead Qualification

## Overview

BAND (Budget, Authority, Need, Decision) is the qualification system used to evaluate prospects and determine if they are qualified leads worth pursuing. This scoring system ensures we focus our sales efforts on prospects with the highest likelihood of conversion.

## Scoring System

**Total Points: 10 points**
**Minimum Qualification Score: 6 points**
**Budget is mandatory (50% weight) - prospects without budget cannot proceed**

## Scoring Breakdown

### Budget (5 points - 50% weight, REQUIRED)

Budget is the most critical qualification factor. If a prospect does not have budget, they cannot proceed regardless of other scores.

**Scoring Criteria:**
- **5 points**: Has confirmed budget of IDR 150M+ (Growing Businesses) or IDR 50M+ (Dreamers)
- **3 points**: Has budget but amount not yet confirmed, or budget is being secured
- **0 points**: No budget available or budget insufficient

**Decision Rule:** If Budget = 0 points, prospect is disqualified regardless of other scores.

### Authority (2 points)

Authority measures whether the prospect has decision-making power or significant influence over the purchasing decision.

**Scoring Criteria:**
- **2 points**: Decision-maker (CEO, Founder, Owner, Director with budget authority)
- **1 point**: Strong influencer (VP, Senior Manager with recommendation authority)
- **0 points**: No authority or unclear role

### Need (2 points)

Need assesses whether the prospect has a clear, urgent problem or opportunity that Synetica can address.

**Scoring Criteria:**
- **2 points**: Clear, urgent need with specific pain points or opportunities identified
- **1 point**: General need but not yet clearly defined or not urgent
- **0 points**: No clear need or just exploring

### Decision (1 point)

Decision evaluates the prospect's readiness to make a decision and timeline expectations.

**Scoring Criteria:**
- **1 point**: Ready to make decision within 3 months, has timeline defined
- **0 points**: No timeline, just exploring, or decision timeline beyond 3 months

## Implementation Guidelines

### Initial Contact Form
- Capture basic information: name, email, company, challenge summary, desired timeline
- Do NOT ask for budget in initial form (to avoid intimidating prospects)

### Follow-up Qualification
- After initial contact, conduct follow-up conversation to assess BAND criteria
- Use conversational approach, not interrogation
- Document scores in CRM or lead management system

### Disqualification Process
- If Budget = 0: Politely explain that we require confirmed budget to proceed, offer to reconnect when budget is available
- If Total < 6: Provide value (resources, insights) but do not invest significant sales time
- If Total ≥ 6: Proceed with consultation and proposal process

### CRM Integration
- Store BAND scores in lead records
- Use scores for lead prioritization and pipeline management
- Track conversion rates by BAND score ranges

## Notes

- **Budget is non-negotiable**: This is the gatekeeper criterion. Without budget, we cannot proceed.
- **Flexibility on other criteria**: Prospects can qualify with various combinations as long as total ≥ 6 and Budget > 0
- **Growing Businesses vs Dreamers**: Budget thresholds differ (IDR 150M+ vs IDR 50M+) but scoring system is the same
- **Timeline expectations**: Decision timeline of 3+ months doesn't disqualify, but reduces score
