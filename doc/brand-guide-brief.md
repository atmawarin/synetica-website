# Synetica Brand Identity & Logo Design Brief

## 0. Origin
Synetica comes from two words: Synergy and Kinetica (motion).
The name reflects how we work and what we deliver — helping ideas move from vision to product through collaboration, structure, and speed. Every project aligns business, design, and technology so they move in sync toward one goal: traction.
In short: Synetica is Collaboration in motion.

## 1. Background
Synetica is a tech-based business consultancy that helps founders and innovation teams move from clarity to traction — fast. We combine strategic thinking, product design, and technology execution to validate ideas and scale outcomes.
Unlike traditional consultancies that stop at strategy or agencies that jump straight into execution, Synetica does both — we think, then build.
In just 8 weeks, we take them from idea to a validated product people can actually use and love.
At Synetica, we use our 8-Week Product Launch™ to turn your idea into a validated product fast.
It’s a practical path: plan smart, build lean, test early, and scale only what works.

## 2. Mission
Our mission is to help businesses think clearly, act decisively, and execute fast. We bridge the gap between strategy and delivery, turning insight into validated products and measurable growth.
The brand should reflect this sense of purpose and motion.

## 3. Brand Core
Essence: From idea to traction — within 8 weeks.
Archetype: The Builder-Sage Hybrid — pragmatic in execution, intelligent in insight.
Synetica combines the Builder’s obsession with progress and clarity with the Sage’s wisdom and structure.
We explore deeply, plan sharply, and execute decisively — ensuring every action connects to a measurable business outcome.
We embrace brainstorming to understand the business deeply, then cut through the noise to find what truly drives traction. The result: clarity that fuels confident execution.
Tone: Smart, confident, and structured. Every word moves from insight to action — grounded in evidence, delivered with clarity.
Promise: We turn ideas into real products — fast, focused, and validated in the market.
One Line: Launch your product in 8 weeks or less.
Values:
- Clarity through exploration — brainstorm wide, then blueprint sharp.
- Momentum over perfection — speed creates data; data drives direction.
- Validation over assumption — build what's proven, not just imagined.

Anti Archetype: We are not the Dreamer or the Theorist. We don’t stop at ideas or decks — we guide, validate, and build what drives traction.
Personality: Sharp, practical, and fast-moving. We combine creative curiosity with operational discipline.

Voice in Action (for Designers)
Every great product starts with clarity.
At Synetica, we begin with a Blueprint — where ideas meet structure.
We explore, define, and validate fast, so what gets built is what truly matters.
In just eight weeks, we take you from concept to traction.

Design cue: Show progression — from open exploration to sharp focus. Use structure, rhythm, and motion to echo that transformation.

## 4. Positioning
Category: Tech-Based Business Consultancy
Positioning: Synetica blends the strategic depth of consulting with the execution power of a product studio.
Why: Businesses need partners who can both think clearly and build fast. Synetica delivers both, using technology as the bridge between insight and traction.
Target: Dreamers & Growing Businesses in Indonesia
Focus: Clarity → Validation → Traction
Differentiator: We stay from idea to adoption — combining business clarity, AI-assisted development, and real-world validation.
Why it matters:
- Dev houses build something that is not always aligned with the business outcome.
- Consultancies strategize but don't ship.
- Synetica does both — we plan, build, and validate.

## 5. Design Direction
Brand Character
The visual identity must communicate clarity, motion, and trust with energy that feels deliberate, not chaotic.
Keywords: Clear Thinking • Momentum • Structure • Human Tech + AI • Focus • Proof
Logo Concept
Type: Wordmark + Symbol system (modular and scalable).
The mark should express “connection and movement” — synergy and motion aligned.
Explore geometry, rhythm, or flow to represent collaboration and speed.
Please avoid blueprint clichés (compasses, grids). Focus on intelligence, energy, and alignment.


Typography
- Primary: Modern geometric sans-serif or grotesque sans (clarity, precision)
- Secondary: Humanist sans-serif or serif accent (depth, empathy) – preferably one with pretty ampersand (e.g., Georgia ampersand in Italic)

Logo Usage
Must work in color, monochrome, and inverted modes.
Should scale smoothly from favicon to signage.
The system must allow for future sub-brand extensions (e.g., Skematika, Optimatika, Humatika, Kognitika). All future sub-brand will use "root + -tika" pattern.
